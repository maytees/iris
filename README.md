# Iris

Iris is hopefully going to be a very simple scripting language created for the purpose of doing small things,
like filesystem automation, and other **_small_** things.

### This is an example of what I hope Iris syntax will look like -

<img src="./example.png" alt="syntax" width="600" />

### How to use?

***Note:*** **The commands below are not implemented yet, this is just for future reference**

*To run an Iris file, you will use the `run` command which takes in a file as an arugment, here is an example:*

***Dev***

```bash
deno run -A ./src/iris.ts run ./hello-world.iris
```

***Prod binary***

```bash
iris run ./hello-world.iris
```
