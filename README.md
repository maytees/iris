# Iris

Iris is hopefully going to be a very simple scripting language created for the
purpose of doing small things, like filesystem automation, and other **_small_**
things.

### This is an example of what I hope Iris syntax will look like -

<img src="./example.png" alt="syntax" width="600" />

### How to use?

_**Note:**_ **The commands below are not implemented yet, this is just for
future reference**

_To run an Iris file, you will use the `run` command which takes in a file as an
arugment, here is an example:_

_**Dev**_

```bash
deno run -A ./src/iris.ts run ./hello-world.iris
```

_**Prod binary**_

```bash
iris run ./hello-world.iris
```
